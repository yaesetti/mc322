## Run Script
Use the script to easily compile and run the RPG<br>

## Disclaimer for Task 4
Even tough the Task Description actively discourage unnecessary keyboard interactions, most outputs made by the program currently require the user to press `Enter` to continue, in order to improve readability and overall aesthetics.

## Disclaimer for Task 5
Documentation is temporally implemented in Brazilian Portuguese. Will be changed later on.
Getters and Setters are intentionally not documented because are too simple.
